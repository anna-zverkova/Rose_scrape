The bush is about three feet, and bushy with upright growth. I have planted three close to one another at the front of a border. I love these roses in a vase; they make lovely arrangements with other apricot-colored roses. The scent is strong and sweet, like myrrh and fruit. My rose can get some blackspot and it needs some extra care, which is worth it for the quality of the roses.\n",

It is not a numerous family, and it is also of less importance to us than many of the others, but we can well imagine what pleasure it gave in years gone by, to the rosarians of the day.  This type makes long, stout shoots, fortified with red thorns of unequal length, but generally short; foliage rather oval, somewhat crimpled; flowers large, or very large, of flat shape, very fill, fragrant, of some shade of rose.  It is the most hardy we have.  The varieties commonly grown are Boieldieu, Colonel de Rougemont, Madame Boll, Oderic Vital.  They are all free bloomers in autumn.\n",

This variety bore royal sway for many years; it not only still sells well and is to be considered a useful rose, but it should also have our esteem as being the parent of the most useful family.  The wood is light green, furnished with occasional thorns; of strong growth; foliage pale green and crimpled.  Flowers various shades of rose, generally of semi-globular form, large, somewhat fragrant; free in the autumn, quite hardy, enduring more cold than any of the other families except Baronne Prévost.  The leading sorts are: Anne de Diesbach, Antoine Moutin, Auguste Mie, Belle Normande, François Michelon, Gloire de Vitry, Laelia, Louise Peyronny,  Alice Dureau, Mme.

The colors are various shadings of crimson, very rich and effective when in perfection, but very fleeting; the sun soon gives them a muddy hue.  The flowers are well shaped, but small, and have slight fragrance; they are freely produced in the spring and the summer months, but, as a rule, not in autumn.  The shoots are of moderate or short growth, short jointed, erect, very stiff, and covered with numerous reddish thorns.  The foliage is of lustrous dark green, very subject to mildew.  They are difficult to propagate from cuttings, and liable to injury from frost.  The leading sorts are: Arthur de Sansal, Cardinal Patrizzi, Crimson Bedder, Empéreur du Maroc, Eugène Appert, Evêque de Nîmes, Lord Raglan, Louis Chaix, Mrs. Standish, Vainqueur de Solferino.\n",

This family probably originated from the old Hybrid China Gloire des Rosomanes; they are moderately hardy, but less so than those of the Baronne Prévost, Jules Margottin and La Reine types.  The flowers are invariably shades of red and crimson, generally high perfumed, freely produced in the spring, but varying greatly as to their autumnal bloom.  As a family they are much more shy in the autumn than any of the others.  \n",

Leading varieties of the type are: Beauty of Waltham, Camille Bernardin (see first plate on page), Dupuy Jamain, Léopold Premier, Marie Baumann (see plate above, left), Marie Rady, Maurice Bernardin, Pierre Notting, Prince Arthur.  There are also Charles Lefebvre, Alfred Colomb, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Camille (see lower plate), and Sénateur Vaisse, which are supposed to be seedlings of Jacqueminot, but they cluster about them other varieties of the family, and are worthy of separate mention and consideration.\n",

      "Victor Verdier Type \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The head of this family originated with Lacharme, of Lyons, and was sent out by him in 1852.  It is doubtless from one of the La Reine type crossed with some monthly rose, probably a Bourbon.  The descendants are very numerous, and in spite of their rather tender habits form a valuable group, being the most free flowering of them all; had they but fragrance they would be unrivalled; but, alas! they are devoid of scent, and therefore cannot rank as high as the others.  Fine feathers alone do not constitute fine birds, and surely fragrance is to the rose what song is to the bird.  The shoots are of moderate growth, stout, upright, nearly smooth, of a reddish green, with an occasional reddish thorn; the foliage is very large, of a deep lustrous green, very attractive.  The flowers are large, well built up; generally shades of rose and pink prevail.  It is the best adapted for forcing in winter of all the families.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The leading varieties grown as André Dunand, Captain Christy, Charles Verdier, Countess of Oxford, Etienne Levet, Hippolyte Jamain, Julius Finger, Mme. Geo. Schwartz, Mme. Dévert, Mme. Eugène Chambeyran, Mme. Louis Donadine, Mme. Maxime de la Rocheterie, Mlle Eugènie Verdier, Marie Cointet, Marie Finger, Mrs. Baker, Oxonian (somewhat fragrant), President Thiers, Pride of Waltham, Rosy Morn, Souvenir de Président Porcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1853 Jules Margottin, of Bourg-la-Reine, near Paris, sent out a fine rose, which he called after himself; though he has been raising seedling roses ever since, none of them have quite come up to this in worth.  Wood, light green; sharp, red thorns, somewhat numerous; shoots rather stout and generally of vigorous growth.  Crimpled foliage.  Flowers of large size, very full, somewhat flat shape, mostly shades of rose and carmine, almost without perfume; generally free in the autumn.  They are very hardy; as a rule difficult of propagation from cuttings, but making very vigorous plants when budded,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abel Grand, Achille Gonod, Bessie Johnson (quite fragrant), Claude Bernard, Countess of Serenye, Duchesse de Vallombrosa, Edward Morren, Egeria, Emily Laxton, John Hopper, Magna Charta, Madame Gabriel Luizet, Madame Lacharme, Madame Louis Lévêque, Mademoiselle Thérèse Levet, Marchioness of Exeter, Marguérite de St. Amande, Marquise de Castellane, Miss Hassard (scented), Monsieur Noman, Paeonia, Peach Blossom, Princess Mary of Cambridge, Rev. J. B. Camm (very sweet), are the leading sorts.\n",
      "(Plate of Jules Margottin left)\n",
      "Sénateur Vaisse Type\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sénateur Vaisse was introduced in 1859.  In this family we find what are perhaps the most perfectly formed flowers.  The varieties are of moderate growth, with smoother wood than most dark roses; the foliage, too, is more round and of a deeper green.  Anicet Bourgeois (new), E. Y. Teas, Madame Adelaide Côte (new), Madame Victor Verdier, and Mrs. Laxton are members of this group.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Lefebvre Type\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lacharme introduced Charles Lefebvre in 1861.  He believes that it is the result of a cross (I infer by natural agencies) between Victor Verdier and General Jacqueminot; it certainly shows many of the characteristics of these two sorts.  The wood and foliage are light green; occasionally armed with pale red thorns, but as a rule the wood is very smooth.  The flowers are more waving in outline than any of the other families; the habit of growth is free, intermediate between Victor Verdier and General Jacqueminot.  Glory of Cheshunt, Harrison Weir, Henry Bennett, Madame Anna de Besobrasoff, Marguérite Brassac, Paul Jamain, President Léon de St. Jean, and W. Wilson Saunders are marked members of this type.  Dr. Andry, Horace Vernet, Lord Macaulay, Mrs. Henry Turner, Rev. W. H. Stomers and Souvenir du Dr. Jamain, also seem to find a place in this group.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1861 E. Verdier sent out Prince Camille de Rohan (see plate left).  In this type we find the darkest, most velvety roses.  It would seem as though this family must have been produced by the blending of General Jacqueminot with Giant of Battles.  The varieties are of vigorous or free growth; the wood is somewhat darker, the spines less numerous, the habit more spreading than those in the Jacqueminot type.  None of them bloom freely in the autumn, but in the spring their wondrous rich crimson shades gain more admirers than any others.  Baron Chaurand, Baron de Bonstetten, La Rosière, Monsieur Boncènne,  are prominent members of this family.  Abel Carrière, Jean Liabaud, Jean Soupert, and Souvenir d'Auguste Rivière can also be classed with these; though they show more of the Giant of Battles character then the former, and might therefore not appropriately be placed by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alfred Colomb Type\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alfred Colomb, sent out in 1865, has a somewhat similar habit of growth to General Jacqueminot, but the thorns are much more numerous, and with a more yellow hue; the flowers are also fuller and more globular, and blossom much more abundantly.  A. K. Williams, Madame Alphonse Lavalle, and Wilhelm Koelle, may be grouped under this head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Duke of Edinburgh Type\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The only English rose which is the head of a type was sent out by George Paul in 1868.  The habit of growth is much like that of Jacqueminot, but the foliage is generally longer and larger.  The flowers are not permanent in color, burning very quickly in the sun, and are sparsely produced in the autumn.  It is a very beautiful family when grown in a moist, cool climate; but there are few of the members that will do well in under our hot sun.  The varieties best known, mostly of recent origin, are: Brightness of Cheshunt, Dr. Hooker, Duke of Connaught, Duke of Teck, Robert Marnock, S. Reynolds Hole, Sultan of Zanzibar, The Shah. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is worthwhile to compare how others have grouped the Hybrid Perpetuals.  Jules Gravereaux, creator of the famous and extraordinary rose collection at l'Haÿ, categorized the Hybrid Perpetuals into twelve groups.  Gravereaux's classification is documented in Les Roses cultivées à l'Haÿ, 1903, twenty one years after Ellwanger's.  La Reine, Baronne Prévost, Géant des Batailles, Victor Verdier, Général Jacqueminot, Jules Margottin, Madame Récamier, Triomphe de l'Exposition, Madame Victor Verdier, Charles Lefebvre, and Baronne A. de Rothschild were prototypes for the first eleven groups. The twelfth group was named Hybrides Remontantes non classés, or Hybrid Perpetuals that could not be classified into one of the other eleven groups.\n",
      "Ellwanger and Gravereaux agreed on seven of the prototypes for the groups: Baronne Prévost, La Reine, Géant des Batailles (*Ellwanger called the rose Giant of Battles), Général Jacqueminot, Victor Verdier, Jules Margottin and Charles Lefebvre.  Ellwanger placed Sénateur Vaisse at the head of a class; whereas, Gravereaux chose Madame Victor Verdier to represent the same class.  Gravereaux grouped Prince Camille with the Général Jacqueminot group. Gravereaux grouped Alfred Colomb and Duke of Edinburgh with the Madame Victor Verdier class.  Gravereaux had three distinct groups, which Ellwanger did not have: Triomphe de l'Exposition, Baronne A. de Rothschild and Madame Récamier.  Ellwanger grouped Madame Récamier with Hybrid Noisettes. Ellwanger did not specify where Baronne Rothschild and Triomphe de l'Exposition should be placed.  He did say, however, that Baronne Rothschild was a very distinct and beautiful rose.\n",
      "It is also interesting to look at the way Reverend Joseph H. Pemberton grouped the Hybrid Perpetuals in comparison.  Each author has an interesting point of view.  It is hard to understand the class without exploring each in some detail.\n",

      "The flowers of this fragrant rose are very double (more than 100 petals), measuring about three inches across.   They are shaped like a ranunculus with a button eye.  The petals are purple-violet with a lighter reverse.  The wood is prickly, and the rose will sucker freely on its own roots.\n",

In 1265 Pope Urban VI declared King Manfred of Naples and Sicily unfit to reign and named Charles of Anjou to replace him.  Charles conquered his new kingdom but was forcibly ejected from Sicily by his subjects in 1282 on the occasion known as the Sicilian Vespers.  He reigned on the remaining half of his kingdom until his death.\n",

      " About eight years ago, we (I mean my wife, Patricia, and I) began to grow roses in our garden.\n",
      "First came the ones you find in every garden center, that is, plants bred anywhere in the world and sold wherever in the world.\n",
      "The result was poor blooms, black spot galore.\n",
      "We started to try old garden roses, both once-blooming and repeat-flowering, and came to the conclusion that the best roses for our terroir (soil, climate, exposure etc.) were the Gallicas and the Hybrid Perpetuals. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A brief summary about this terroir: Middle temperature in July, 63° F (17° Celsius), January, 37° F (2,5° Celsius) (USDA zone 8). Rainfall approximately 33 inches (830 millimeters) a year, with an even repartition through the year. Heavy soil with a high clay content, PH about 6,5.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to stay practical, I won't go too deep in historical or scientific matters. I warmly recommend a look at the page from B. C. Dickerson for those who want to know more about the history of the Hybrid Perpetuals:\n",
      "http://www.rdrop.com/~paul/dickerson_HP.html\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a Hybrid Perpetual?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a question that is open to vast debate.\n",
      "It seems that in the beginning (the 1830's) it was a hotchpotch category where people placed all the repeat-flowering roses that could not  be classified with: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially the name, Hybrides Remontants, meant repeat flowering hybrids a vague definition for roses that were repeat-flowering hybrids of whatever possible.  This resulted in a lot of confusion, which still exists today. But, by 1842, with the introduction of 'La Reine', there was a redefining of the class.  The Hybrid Perpetuals that followed were clearly a rather big family with common characteristics.  Looking back, we can see that the first Hybrid Perpetuals were a synthesis of Portlands and reblooming Hybrid Chinas* with some Gallica parentage. For information about this, see another page from B C Dickerson at http://www.rdrop.com/~paul/dickerson_HybCh.html\n",
      "\n",
      "By studying the material and observing the Hybrid Perpetuals I grow, I found they could be grouped into five  lineages.  Maybe there are more.  It is difficult to tell because some roses have disappeared or may not have been referenced.\n",
      "Before describing the lineages, let's see what the Hybrid Perpetuals have in common, and why it's worth bothering about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are merely shrubs, and rather cumbersome. Some are bushes, but even these should not be used for group plantings or in mixed-borders (too greedy!).\n",
      "There are a fair number of climbers, too, particularly among the purple colored ones.\n",
      "These roses date back to a period when the breeders began to try and follow scientific methods.  Consequently, there were many trial and errors.\n",
      "Their only concern was for the perfection of the bloom, not the value of the rose as a garden plant - this notion did not exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, the parents of the first Hybrid Perpetuals were extremely fine, so they show great qualities and have stood the test of time:\n",
      "\n",
      "- One could say that the Hybrid Perpetuals are Classic, neither old like Gallicas, nor modern like the Hybrid Teas.\n",
      "- In my climate in Belgium, the Hybrid Perpetuals do better than the Hybrids Teas. This is also possibly true for areas like British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, and the southern island of New Zealand, among others.\n",
      "In Europe, the Hybrid Perpetuals do not mind cool weather and rain, with the exception of the more delicate blooms that can ball. They suffer when the weather is hot.\n",
      "But there is a mystery here, because in California, South Africa, and Southern and South Western Australia, the same varieties can thrive in cemeteries and without care for a long time. This is perplexing. The heredity of\n",
      "these roses is rather complex, and many environmental factors must be interacting together. Thus, the Hybrid Perpetuals are ideal for cool climates, but if you live in the above mentioned areas,\n",
      "do not hesitate to try them there too.  Robert Edberg, who has grown antique roses since 1942, states that he grew the following Hybrid Perpetuals in sunny California, zone 10, with great success:\n",
      "'Paul Neyron', 'La Reine', 'Anna de Diesbach', 'Baronne Prévost', 'Mrs. R. G. Sharman-Crawford', 'James Bougault', 'Gloire Lyonnaise', 'Mme Verdier', 'Comtesse Cécile de Chabrillant' and 'Gloire de Ducher'.  These roses can be recommended for warmer areas, but it is important to remember that there is no guarantee that what does well in your neighbor's garden will do well in yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be grown successfully in USDA zone 5, some of them could even do zone 4.\n",
      "From a hardiness point of view, they fall just between the Gallicas and the Hybrid Teas. A practical rule of thumb could consist of this: as cold as zone 5 and where the Gallicas do well, you can be successful with Hybrid Perpetuals.\n",
      "In these conditions they are easy to grow, with some attention paid to their needs.  Please take the following into account for successful results:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why have the Hybrid Perpetuals been Forgotten?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the result of a pendulum effect. From about 1850 to 1900, the Hybrid Perpetuals were in fashion to the point of overshadowing the popularity of other roses.\n",
      "Later, they were themselves obscured by the Hybrids Teas.\n",
      "Even now, many rosarians have no interest in them. But for the gardeners of today, with today's taste, they are the large-flowered-roses par excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the Drawbacks of the Hybrid Perpetuals?\n",
      "\n",
      "1). They are, with exceptions, cumbersome. Nothing for small gardens, unless one or two are grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "2). They are greedy. To get heavy, large and fully double flowers two times in a season, there is a price to pay.\n",
      "Rich soil, regular applications of organic fertilizers (manure) and watering are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3). Exercise care when choosing their placement in the garden: some partial shade during the hottest hours, never against walls or in confined places. This is important to avoid mildew and black spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "4). The purple-colored Hybrid Perpetuals, among the finest of red roses, are susceptible to rust. This does not occur every year, but it is wise to check the undersides of the leaves regularly. So you can immediately dispose of infected ones before getting\n",
      "problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5). From a remontancy point of view, the Hybrid Perpetuals are, again, between the once-blooming Gallicas and the modern, everblooming roses like the Floribunda.\n",
      "You'll get a rich blooming in June, and another more timid one from mid-August to mid-September, sometimes a bit later. They tend to do better with age.\n",
      "In countries with short summers, this is not a drawback, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dates and the Lineages\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is open to debate, but for practical reasons I think we should consider 'La Reine' (Laffay 1842) as the first Hybrid Perpetual:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Because of the rare availability of the older Proto-Hybrid Perpetuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Because 'La Reine', or its parent 'William Jesse' that is on sale in the U.S., is the first Hybrid Perpetual known to have a vast documented descent.\n",
      "The 'La Reine' lineage includes, with many others, 'John Hopper', 'Baroness Rothschild', and 'Jules Margottin'.\n",
      "They are all rose-colored, with some white sports. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1846, 'Géant des Batailles' (Nérard) appeared as a seedling, from the all-important parent 'Gloire des Rosomanes' (Plantier 1825, marketed by Vibert). Whether 'Gloire des Rosomanes' is a Bourbon or a China Hybrid is uncertain. The fertile triploid looks something like a Multiflora hybrid. (All the Hybrid Perpetuals are supposedly tetraploids)  It has been used as a stock in the U.S. under the name 'Ragged Robin'. And ragged it is, for I do not know of a more robust and vigorous rose, virtually budding by itself - a little piece forgotten when pruning can root where it is-\n",
      "a very unusual rose indeed. The other parent is unknown, but I believe it could well have been 'Rose du Roi' (1815) or one of its sports or varieties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The English rosarian William Paul wrote in The Rose Garden of 1848 that 'Géant des Batailles'\n",
      "was a giant step in the right direction towards combining the wonderful red color of 'Gloire des Rosomanes' with more double flowers. He said he tried with seedlings but was never able to obtain fuller blooms himself.\n",
      "Five years later his opinions on 'Géant des Batailles' would prove correct.\n",
      "For more information, please refer to my article (in French) at Ivan Louette's site. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Général Jacqueminot' (Roussel 1853) came as seed by crossing 'Géant des Batailles' with 'Gloire des Rosomanes'.  A huge number of varieties without any reported exterior influence (Sports and other crosses between these roses only) resulted from this meeting.  This series, which I call the Rosomènes, are the roses I prefer between all. Even today they remain unequalled with their deep-purple, maroon, sometimes close to black colors, their amazing scent, and the utmost refinement of the flower.\n",
      "Among many others you'll find here are 'Général Jacqueminot', 'Eugene Fürst', 'Baron Girod de l'Ain', 'Baron de Bonstetten', and 'Fisher Holmes'. These roses must be grown in partial shade, otherwise the sun will burn their blooms and the mildew will eat their foliage! The climbers should never be placed against walls, a tree between three to five meters is by far preferable (not an oak, something like an apple).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1859, the French breeder Lacharme united a member of the 'La Reine' lineage with the Tea 'Safrano' as pollen parent.\n",
      "This first Hybrid Perpetual to receive Tea genes was 'Victor Verdier' (not 'Mme 'Victor Verdier'!)\n",
      "Please note 'Safrano' was the pollen parent. When the breeders used the Tea rose as a seed, they obtained the first Hybrids Teas (According to the breeder Peter Lambert) It is so that Bennett bred his 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam', with the Tea 'Devoniensis' as seed.\n",
      "Examples of the 'Victor Verdier' tribe are 'Paul Neyron', 'Ulrich Brunner', 'Etienne Levet', and 'Captain Christy'. Note that some of these may be classified with the Hybrid Teas by other authors, because certain aspects of the roses belong to the Hybrid Teas.\n",
      "The majority are rose-colored, plus some whites and bright reds. None present the purples tones of the Rosomènes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1861, came 'Charles Lefebvre', again from Lacharme. The cross was 'Général Jacqueminot' by 'Victor Verdier', thus a blend of the 'Victor Verdier' and the 'Gloire des Rosomanes' classes.\n",
      "The result was a new lineage, the 'Charles Lefebvre', which combines a Tea influence with the purple tints. Few of these remain in commerce today, essentially 'Charles Lefebvre' and 'Souvenir du Docteur Jamain'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The last lineage came later, from the German breeder Peter Lambert. He released\n",
      "'Frau Karl Druschki' in 1900, the cross being 'Merveille de Lyon' (a white sport of 'Baroness Rothschild') pollinated by one of the firsts Hybrids Teas, 'Mme Caroline Testout'. Even today, 'Frau Karl Druschki' remains among the finest white roses available.\n",
      "And here again, this rose will be used as a seed parent, giving us a new lineage with\n",
      "'Ruhm von Steinfurth', 'Candeur Lyonnaise', 'Heinrich Münch', 'Georg Arends'.  The last Hybrid Perpetual could well be 'Goldene Druschki', which can  be seen at l'Haÿ-les-Roses (Lambert 1936).\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of the Hybrid Perpetuals goes, then, from 1842 to 1936. They were obtained by thousands for nearly a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Remains of them Today?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the trade, not many, with the exception of the U.S.A. Some very specialized nurseries offer some of them. The best in Europe is the Schultheis nursery in Germany, which sells 70 varieties.\n",
      "The champion worldwide seems to be Vintage Gardens near San Francisco, CA, with 144 varieties.\n",
      "In the public collections, there are 477 of them to be seen at the Roseraie dèpartementale du Val-De-Marne at l'Haÿ-les-Roses near Paris, and 465 in the Rosarium of Sangerhausen in Germany.\n",

      "The Hybrid Noisette Rose is a comparatively new group of considerable importance.  The varieties of this class generally, though not always, flower in small clusters and bloom very freely throughout the season; they are of about the same degree of hardiness as the Bourbons - that is will winter with perfect safety if given some slight protection, such as hilling up earth about the plants or covering them with loose litter or evergreen branches.  It is not easy to ascertain the origin of the class, but the varieties are mostly from crosses of Bourbon on Noisette and vice versa.  \n",
      "They all require pretty severe pruning.  The most beautiful in the class are Madame Norman, Mdlle. Bonnaire, and Eliza Boelle, a trio of white roses which might well represent the three Graces.  There are too strong a resemblance between them to make all desirable in a small collection, but it is difficult to know which of them to reject.  Our own preference inclines towards Madame Norman. These are the most delicate in habit; of the stronger growing varieties which partake more of the Noisette character, Coquette des Alpes, Coquette des Blanches (see plate left), and Mme Auguste Perrin are most noteworthy.  Baronne de Maynard, Madame Alfred de Rougemont, and Madame François Pittet are worthy a place in collections of considerable extent.\n",

      "\n",
      "The flowers are of medium size, and of circular, very beautiful form.  The growth is moderate, or dwarf.  The foliage is rather small and somewhat crimpled; the wood light green, fortified with numerous small spines.  Though devoid of fragrance, these are our most charming white roes; the flowers are freely produced throughout June and the summer months.  The varieties belonging to the type are Eliza Boelle, Madame Norman and Madame Oswald de Kerchove.\n",

The habit of growth is free or vigorous; the wood is smoother, the foliage more oval and glaucous, like the Bourbon roses; the flowers are even more freely produced than those of the other type, but are inferior to them in quality.  The principal sorts are: Baronne de Maynard, Coquette des Alpes, Coquette des Blanches (see plate above), Madame Auguste Perrin, Madame François Pittet, Perfection des Blanches.\n",

      "  Ivan says the following about this rose: \"'Coriandre' was a natural seedling which occured in my rose garden at a time I grew very few botanical roses. Thus it was very easy to identify it as a crossing between a double rugosa (I hesitate between 'Parfum de L'Haÿ' and another unknown one) and a well perfumed clone of R. palustris I got from Louis Lens.  It has a strong and refined spiced perfume reminiscent of coriander seeds and bergamote, which can be carried far away in the air (up to 20 m after warm summer rains).\n",
      "I have sown the achenes of 'Coriandre' open pollinated and I obtained many different forms, all interesting to put in an hedge. Some of them are nearly identical to double flowered R. palustris, other ones are close to rugosa (I have a deep purplish carmine one with cup shaped flowers), and another very special form has shiny carolina like foliage and large double flowers with an hemispherical receptacle like the Banshee rose or 'Rose d'Amour' and 'Rose d'Orsay'. I have sown this one too and I am waiting for the first flowers on its very variable descendants, perhaps this year.\"\n",

      "The Damask was the premier rose in the early days of the last century, and fertilizing the Damask with the Hybrid China produced in this, the third generation from R. indica, the Hybrid Perpetual, which thus combines in its constitution the strain of R. indica, French Provence, and Damask, the influence of the last named preponderating.  It is, however, difficult to account exactly for the Hybrid Perpetual, because the scientific method under which the seed of the modern roses is obtained was not pursued at that time.  Apparently the practice was to gather the seed heps which had been naturally fertilized by wind or insects, and sow the seed in beds in the open; thus they ere chance seedlings from flowers naturally, not artificially, fertilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first so-called Hybrid Perpetual* as we have observed, was that known as the Damask Perpetual, Rose du Roi, or Lee's Perpetual, but since this variety is said to have owed its origin not to a cross with another hybrid, but to a doubtful species, the Rose of Paestum, and is thus, like a Hybrid China, a rose of the first generation, we are not surprised to learn that several of the best varieties, of which the Damask Perpetual was the parent, were only summer flowering.  Before a reliable race of Hybrid Perpetual was obtained, the Damask Perpetual had to be crossed with the Bourbon and China, and for this we are indebted to M. Laffay, the originator of the Hybrid Perpetual as we have it now.**  Some of the earliest and most noteworthy sent out were Princess Hélène (1837), Duchess of Sutherland (see top illustration)  and Madame Laffay (1839), Queen Victoria (1840) (see second illustration and notes at bottom of the page), La Reine (1843) and William Jesse (see lower illustration).  By 1840 twenty varieties were catalogued, and although many more were brought out during the next twenty years, nevertheless they were not of such excellence as to entirely supersede the old summer-flowering favourites.  The one hundred varieties which, in 1857, won chief prize for cut roses comprised only fifty-four Hybrid Perpetuals, twenty-three others being summer-flowering.  The Hybrid Perpetual reigned supreme from 1860 to 1890; there were no Hybrid Teas or large Teas to challenge its position.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Victor Verdier (Lacharme, 1859).  This is the chief parent of the class.  To it we are indebted for those short, stout, upright, free-flowering varieties, such as Marie Finger, Étienne Levet. Comtesse d'Oxford and Suzanne Marie Rodocanachi.  Rabbits are fond of this class, especially the last-named variety, preferring it to any Tea or Hybrid Tea; and from this fact we may conclude that a high degree of the Tea element (R. indica) is contained in the Victor Verdier race. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be of little practical service to enumerate here the best Hybrid Perpetuals, the list is ever changing, and the appendix will, one trusts, supply the requisite information.  Since 1890 this race has remained almost stationary, the Hybrid Teas being now the progressive party.  But before we pass to a few words on cultivation, permit it to be once more emphasized that we expect and must have perfume in a rose - the perfume derived from the strain of Damask and Hybrid Perpetual; and let us hope that our eminent raisers of new varieties will give this point some little consideration.  Lovers of the Queen of Flowers look for that virtue in her that makes her the queen, and without which she is but a camellia or a cactus dahlia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful of the roses of this class are, yet, taken as a whole, Hybrid Perpetuals are not good autumnal flowers; they are surpassed by the Teas, Hybrid Teas, and Chinas.  Nevertheless, in brilliancy of colour nothing can equal them; poor indeed would be the rose garden that did not contain such sorts as Charles Lefébvre, Comte Raimbaud, Horace Vernet, Marie Baumann, Ulrich Brünner, and Victor Hugo; we cannot afford to lose these roses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we come to consider the question of pruning and general culture of the Hybrid Perpetual we are at a loss to know exactly what to say.  Each variety has its idiosyncrasy; its own virtue and fault, its own habit and growth, the knowledge of which can be obtained only by close acquaintanceship.  For instance, no rule as to pruning could be laid down, even for garden purposes, which would be equally applicable, let us say, to Ulrich Brünner and Victor Hugo, nor, if required for exhibition, would be the same advice on disbudding suit both Générale Jacqueminot and Her Majesty.  All we can state here is that the Hybrid Perpetual is hardy, and in a normal winter requires no protection.  Like most roses it does best in open situations, or apart from other flowers.  It should be left unpruned, but the weaker the variety the harder - the shorter- should it be cut, and vice versa.\n",

      "'Ellen Willmott' is a rose that dances, opening to light.  In darkened or cloudy light, the rose's petals close over stamens as if in a prayer pose. Warmed by the sun, the petals open gracefully as if they were wings on a meditational butterfly.  The opening of petals is in tune with the mysterious timing of nature, because it is just in time for the bees that unobtrusively parade to receive the pollen that she graciously provides on top of wine stained stamens.  The plant is about 3 feet high and like an upright tea, with plum colored new foliage, which darkens to a matte green.  Captain Thomas wrote that the rose had remarkably fine foliage, and the plant is blessed with good health.  The ivory petals are scalloped and warm to shades of peach along the edges.  The slender buds come in small clusters, sometimes singly.  The parents of 'Ellen Willmott' are 'Dainty Bess' and 'Lady Hillingdon'.  The rose was developed by Archer in 1936.  The rose is strong on its own roots. 'Ellen Willmott' was an extraordinary artist, gardener, and writer of The Genus Rosa.  If roses had eyelashes this one could certainly bat her eyes.\n",

This small shrub, with stiff wood and many prickles, reaches about three feet.  The foliage is dark green and handsome with a lighter underside.  Leaflets are in the shape of a spoon, and stipules and veins of the leaves are crimson.  Not remontant. \n",

      "\n",
      "A brief summary about this terroir: Middle temperature in July, 63° F (17° Celsius), January, 37° F (2,5° Celsius) (USDA zone 8). Rainfall approximately 33 inches (830 millimeters) a year, with an even repartition through the year. Heavy soil with a high clay content, PH about 6,5.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to stay practical, I won't go too deep in historical or scientific matters. I warmly recommend a look at the page from B. C. Dickerson for those who want to know more about the history of the Hybrid Perpetuals:\n",
      "http://www.rdrop.com/~paul/dickerson_HP.html\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a Hybrid Perpetual?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a question that is open to vast debate.\n",
      "It seems that in the beginning (the 1830's) it was a hotchpotch category where people placed all the repeat-flowering roses that could not  be classified with: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially the name, Hybrides Remontants, meant repeat flowering hybrids a vague definition for roses that were repeat-flowering hybrids of whatever possible.  This resulted in a lot of confusion, which still exists today. But, by 1842, with the introduction of 'La Reine', there was a redefining of the class.  The Hybrid Perpetuals that followed were clearly a rather big family with common characteristics.  Looking back, we can see that the first Hybrid Perpetuals were a synthesis of Portlands and reblooming Hybrid Chinas* with some Gallica parentage. For information about this, see another page from B C Dickerson at http://www.rdrop.com/~paul/dickerson_HybCh.html\n",
      "\n",
      "By studying the material and observing the Hybrid Perpetuals I grow, I found they could be grouped into five  lineages.  Maybe there are more.  It is difficult to tell because some roses have disappeared or may not have been referenced.\n",
      "Before describing the lineages, let's see what the Hybrid Perpetuals have in common, and why it's worth bothering about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are merely shrubs, and rather cumbersome. Some are bushes, but even these should not be used for group plantings or in mixed-borders (too greedy!).\n",
      "There are a fair number of climbers, too, particularly among the purple colored ones.\n",
      "These roses date back to a period when the breeders began to try and follow scientific methods.  Consequently, there were many trial and errors.\n",
      "Their only concern was for the perfection of the bloom, not the value of the rose as a garden plant - this notion did not exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, the parents of the first Hybrid Perpetuals were extremely fine, so they show great qualities and have stood the test of time:\n",
      "\n",
      "- One could say that the Hybrid Perpetuals are Classic, neither old like Gallicas, nor modern like the Hybrid Teas.\n",
      "- In my climate in Belgium, the Hybrid Perpetuals do better than the Hybrids Teas. This is also possibly true for areas like British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, and the southern island of New Zealand, among others.\n",
      "In Europe, the Hybrid Perpetuals do not mind cool weather and rain, with the exception of the more delicate blooms that can ball. They suffer when the weather is hot.\n",
      "But there is a mystery here, because in California, South Africa, and Southern and South Western Australia, the same varieties can thrive in cemeteries and without care for a long time. This is perplexing. The heredity of\n",
      "these roses is rather complex, and many environmental factors must be interacting together. Thus, the Hybrid Perpetuals are ideal for cool climates, but if you live in the above mentioned areas,\n",
      "do not hesitate to try them there too.  Robert Edberg, who has grown antique roses since 1942, states that he grew the following Hybrid Perpetuals in sunny California, zone 10, with great success:\n",
      "'Paul Neyron', 'La Reine', 'Anna de Diesbach', 'Baronne Prévost', 'Mrs. R. G. Sharman-Crawford', 'James Bougault', 'Gloire Lyonnaise', 'Mme Verdier', 'Comtesse Cécile de Chabrillant' and 'Gloire de Ducher'.  These roses can be recommended for warmer areas, but it is important to remember that there is no guarantee that what does well in your neighbor's garden will do well in yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be grown successfully in USDA zone 5, some of them could even do zone 4.\n",
      "From a hardiness point of view, they fall just between the Gallicas and the Hybrid Teas. A practical rule of thumb could consist of this: as cold as zone 5 and where the Gallicas do well, you can be successful with Hybrid Perpetuals.\n",
      "In these conditions they are easy to grow, with some attention paid to their needs.  Please take the following into account for successful results:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why have the Hybrid Perpetuals been Forgotten?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the result of a pendulum effect. From about 1850 to 1900, the Hybrid Perpetuals were in fashion to the point of overshadowing the popularity of other roses.\n",
      "Later, they were themselves obscured by the Hybrids Teas.\n",
      "Even now, many rosarians have no interest in them. But for the gardeners of today, with today's taste, they are the large-flowered-roses par excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the Drawbacks of the Hybrid Perpetuals?\n",
      "\n",
      "1). They are, with exceptions, cumbersome. Nothing for small gardens, unless one or two are grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "2). They are greedy. To get heavy, large and fully double flowers two times in a season, there is a price to pay.\n",
      "Rich soil, regular applications of organic fertilizers (manure) and watering are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3). Exercise care when choosing their placement in the garden: some partial shade during the hottest hours, never against walls or in confined places. This is important to avoid mildew and black spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "4). The purple-colored Hybrid Perpetuals, among the finest of red roses, are susceptible to rust. This does not occur every year, but it is wise to check the undersides of the leaves regularly. So you can immediately dispose of infected ones before getting\n",
      "problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5). From a remontancy point of view, the Hybrid Perpetuals are, again, between the once-blooming Gallicas and the modern, everblooming roses like the Floribunda.\n",
      "You'll get a rich blooming in June, and another more timid one from mid-August to mid-September, sometimes a bit later. They tend to do better with age.\n",
      "In countries with short summers, this is not a drawback, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dates and the Lineages\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is open to debate, but for practical reasons I think we should consider 'La Reine' (Laffay 1842) as the first Hybrid Perpetual:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Because of the rare availability of the older Proto-Hybrid Perpetuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Because 'La Reine', or its parent 'William Jesse' that is on sale in the U.S., is the first Hybrid Perpetual known to have a vast documented descent.\n",
      "The 'La Reine' lineage includes, with many others, 'John Hopper', 'Baroness Rothschild', and 'Jules Margottin'.\n",
      "They are all rose-colored, with some white sports. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1846, 'Géant des Batailles' (Nérard) appeared as a seedling, from the all-important parent 'Gloire des Rosomanes' (Plantier 1825, marketed by Vibert). Whether 'Gloire des Rosomanes' is a Bourbon or a China Hybrid is uncertain. The fertile triploid looks something like a Multiflora hybrid. (All the Hybrid Perpetuals are supposedly tetraploids)  It has been used as a stock in the U.S. under the name 'Ragged Robin'. And ragged it is, for I do not know of a more robust and vigorous rose, virtually budding by itself - a little piece forgotten when pruning can root where it is-\n",
      "a very unusual rose indeed. The other parent is unknown, but I believe it could well have been 'Rose du Roi' (1815) or one of its sports or varieties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The English rosarian William Paul wrote in The Rose Garden of 1848 that 'Géant des Batailles'\n",
      "was a giant step in the right direction towards combining the wonderful red color of 'Gloire des Rosomanes' with more double flowers. He said he tried with seedlings but was never able to obtain fuller blooms himself.\n",
      "Five years later his opinions on 'Géant des Batailles' would prove correct.\n",
      "For more information, please refer to my article (in French) at Ivan Louette's site. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Général Jacqueminot' (Roussel 1853) came as seed by crossing 'Géant des Batailles' with 'Gloire des Rosomanes'.  A huge number of varieties without any reported exterior influence (Sports and other crosses between these roses only) resulted from this meeting.  This series, which I call the Rosomènes, are the roses I prefer between all. Even today they remain unequalled with their deep-purple, maroon, sometimes close to black colors, their amazing scent, and the utmost refinement of the flower.\n",
      "Among many others you'll find here are 'Général Jacqueminot', 'Eugene Fürst', 'Baron Girod de l'Ain', 'Baron de Bonstetten', and 'Fisher Holmes'. These roses must be grown in partial shade, otherwise the sun will burn their blooms and the mildew will eat their foliage! The climbers should never be placed against walls, a tree between three to five meters is by far preferable (not an oak, something like an apple).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1859, the French breeder Lacharme united a member of the 'La Reine' lineage with the Tea 'Safrano' as pollen parent.\n",
      "This first Hybrid Perpetual to receive Tea genes was 'Victor Verdier' (not 'Mme 'Victor Verdier'!)\n",
      "Please note 'Safrano' was the pollen parent. When the breeders used the Tea rose as a seed, they obtained the first Hybrids Teas (According to the breeder Peter Lambert) It is so that Bennett bred his 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam', with the Tea 'Devoniensis' as seed.\n",
      "Examples of the 'Victor Verdier' tribe are 'Paul Neyron', 'Ulrich Brunner', 'Etienne Levet', and 'Captain Christy'. Note that some of these may be classified with the Hybrid Teas by other authors, because certain aspects of the roses belong to the Hybrid Teas.\n",
      "The majority are rose-colored, plus some whites and bright reds. None present the purples tones of the Rosomènes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1861, came 'Charles Lefebvre', again from Lacharme. The cross was 'Général Jacqueminot' by 'Victor Verdier', thus a blend of the 'Victor Verdier' and the 'Gloire des Rosomanes' classes.\n",
      "The result was a new lineage, the 'Charles Lefebvre', which combines a Tea influence with the purple tints. Few of these remain in commerce today, essentially 'Charles Lefebvre' and 'Souvenir du Docteur Jamain'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The last lineage came later, from the German breeder Peter Lambert. He released\n",
      "'Frau Karl Druschki' in 1900, the cross being 'Merveille de Lyon' (a white sport of 'Baroness Rothschild') pollinated by one of the firsts Hybrids Teas, 'Mme Caroline Testout'. Even today, 'Frau Karl Druschki' remains among the finest white roses available.\n",
      "And here again, this rose will be used as a seed parent, giving us a new lineage with\n",
      "'Ruhm von Steinfurth', 'Candeur Lyonnaise', 'Heinrich Münch', 'Georg Arends'.  The last Hybrid Perpetual could well be 'Goldene Druschki', which can  be seen at l'Haÿ-les-Roses (Lambert 1936).\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of the Hybrid Perpetuals goes, then, from 1842 to 1936. They were obtained by thousands for nearly a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Remains of them Today?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the trade, not many, with the exception of the U.S.A. Some very specialized nurseries offer some of them. The best in Europe is the Schultheis nursery in Germany, which sells 70 varieties.\n",
      "The champion worldwide seems to be Vintage Gardens near San Francisco, CA, with 144 varieties.\n",
      "In the public collections, there are 477 of them to be seen at the Roseraie dèpartementale du Val-De-Marne at l'Haÿ-les-Roses near Paris, and 465 in the Rosarium of Sangerhausen in Germany.\n",

They believed the rose resulted from an accidental cross between 'Old Blush' and a Quatre Saisons on the Bourbon Island, now La Réunion, in the Indian Ocean. However, we have known for some years that the Bourbon Rose, 'Rose Edouard', existed in India far before the French settled on the Bourbon Island*.  The rose's parents, of which we know very little, were actually ancestors of the China and Damask roses.\n",

Despite the fact we tend to believe that the 19th-century breeders \"relied solely on Mother Nature\", there seems to have been a definite aim in the breeding of 'Gloire des Rosomanes': The wish to have a red version of the Bourbon rose. As a result there was a duplication of what was believed to have given the Bourbon rose: A cross between a China and a repeat-flowering Damask.  I, along with some others, believe that 'Gloire de Rosomanes' could have been the cross between R. chinensis semperflorens (we of course don't know which one) and The Portland Rose.\n",

      "it gave 'Géant des Batailles' (Nérard 1846).   When 'Géant des Batailles' was back-crossed with 'Gloire des Rosomanes' it gave 'Général Jacqueminot' (Roussel 1853), which may be seen as the first classic red Hybrid Perpetual, a progenitor that contributed vastly to the red Hybrid Teas.\n",

      "This beautiful old garden favourite is a variety of the Damask Rose, in which the characters of Rosa gallica L. predominate.  From the typical Rosa gallica it differs by its larger and stouter hooked prickles, less coriaceous leaves, longer peduncles, more abundant flowers, white petals edged with pink after the manner of a picotee, and sepals falling at an earlier stage of the fruit.  It is consequently nearly allied to Rosa damascena Mill. and Rosa alba L.  No doubt it is a garden hybrid, of which Rosa gallica is the predominate parent, and perhaps Rosa alba the other.  By William Paul (1) it is classified as a \"Hybrid Perpetual,\" but nothing is really known of its origin.  It is popularly known as \"Hebe's Lip\" or \"Reine Blanche.\"\n",
